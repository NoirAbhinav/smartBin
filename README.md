# IOT - SMART BIN
This is an IOT project on Smart Bin. When any waste is put in the bins, it automatically detects the type of waste and segregates accordingly and puts the waste in that corresponding bin.
All the bins are equipped with a GPS sensor to locate them, an ultrasonic sensor to detect the level to which it is filled, and other modules to communicate their status on a public portal. On the portal, the user needs to enter the pincode of the area he/she wants to search, and the output result displays the list of all the bins available in that region. Each bin has a unique bin id of that area and the list displays the bin id, its status, filled %, last cleaned date and a priority. This priority of the bins is dynamic which takes multiple bin's parameters to evaluate the priority.

To run the project:
1. Clone the repo.
2. Open the index.html file and enter the pincode of the desired area.
